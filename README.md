# Github API

## Epicodus Javascript Code Review, Week 1

##### A simple app that allows the user to search for github users and their public repositories thru use of the Github API. A search will return a user's avatar, full name, email address, and # of followers. It will also list all of the github user's repositories; including information about each individual repo's description, # of stars, and a link to view.
